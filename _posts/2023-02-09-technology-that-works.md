I have the feeling that in the last few years, technology has become overly complex. I used to be excited about new software releases, and new devices.
Now, I mostly wait until my laptop tells me that I have to upgrade the OS or I won't get any more security patches. 

However, there are two devices I have been using recently that reminded me how exciting technology can be: [Remarkable](https://remarkable.com/)
and [Beeline Velo 2](https://beeline.co/pages/beeline-cycling).

They do one thing, but well. I don't need to charge them every day. I can't use them to procrastinate. They have a net positive impact on my life.

I guess that when a business model doesn't rely on hijhacking people's attention to show them ads, technology can feel exciting again.
